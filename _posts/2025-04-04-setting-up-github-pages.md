## Getting Set Up With Github Pages

I set this site up following the tutorial here:  
[https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)

I also set this up to run under the blog subdomain of my website by following the Github instructions here:  
[Github pages, configure a subdomain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain)
