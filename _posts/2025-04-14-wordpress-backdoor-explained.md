# Examining a Basic WordPress Backdoor

In this video I examine and test a basic WordPress backdoor script that was found on a client's website. 

This type of backdoor is used to provide an attacker with access to the website even if the original vulnerability that allowed them to compromise the website is patched or removed.

[The full, commented, backdoor script can be found here](https://github.com/rmmoul/wordpress-malware-samples/blob/main/hexadecimal-obfuscated-auto-login.php). I'm building a library of WordPress malware samples with explainations of what they do [in a repository here](https://github.com/rmmoul/wordpress-malware-samples/tree/main).
