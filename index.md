Coding since 1994 when I found QBasic on my Tandy PC around 8 years old and then I moved on to Visual Basic, c and c++. I've been working with PHP and Wordpress professionally since 2011, and I dabble with python for some side projects.   

This space is for infrequent technical write ups, disorganized musings, and to help me remember lessons learned from various projects.
